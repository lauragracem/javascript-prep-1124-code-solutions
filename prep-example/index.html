    <h1>I would like to build</h1>
    <p>
      I have always been interested in contributing to EdTech somehow. Recently,
      I saw some brand designs created by software engineers that exemplified
      the sector where creativity meets corporate. I can't imagine the skill
      level of those engineers. It was wildly awesome. I didn't know developers
      worked with brand design, so that has peaked my interest a little. I have
      utilized apps that help with sightreading and notation. I've always
      wondered what it takes to create an app like that.
